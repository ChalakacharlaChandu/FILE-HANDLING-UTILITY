### File Handling in Java - Utility and Operations

This repository showcases a set of Java programs that demonstrate fundamental file handling operations, including creating, reading, writing, modifying, appending, and deleting files. The primary objective of these utilities is to provide a practical approach to managing file I/O in Java while adhering to best practices and efficiency.

#### Key Features

1. **File Handling Utility**: This utility offers a simple, interactive way to perform basic file operations:

   * Write to file: Prompts the user to input content and writes it to a specified file.
   * Read from file: Reads and displays the contents of the file.
   * Modify file: Allows users to update existing content.
   * Exit: Gracefully terminates the utility.
   * Interactive Menu: User-friendly options for easy file management.

2. **File Operations Demo**: This program demonstrates advanced file handling capabilities:

   * File Creation: Generates a new file with specified content.
   * Line Appending: Adds new lines to the existing file content without overwriting.
   * File Reading: Displays the current contents of the file.
   * File Deletion: Removes the file once the operations are complete.
   * Informative Logging: Provides clear messages indicating the success of each operation.

#### Example Output

1. **File Handling Utility**:

   * The user is prompted to enter the file name and content. The content is then successfully written and can be read back from the file.

2. **File Operations Demo**:

   * Displays messages such as 'File created and written successfully', 'Line appended to file', and 'File deleted successfully'. The output also shows the complete content of the file after each operation, ensuring transparency.

#### Technologies Used

* Java 17
* Windows Command Line
* File I/O Streams (BufferedWriter, FileReader, BufferedReader)
* Exception Handling for robust file operations

#### How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/java-file-handling.git
   cd java-file-handling
   ```
2. Compile the Java files:

   ```bash
   javac FileHandlingUtility.java
   javac FileOperationsDemo.java
   ```
3. Run the utilities:

   ```bash
   java FileHandlingUtility
   java FileOperationsDemo
   ```

#### Practical Applications

* Data Logging: Save and read user inputs in text format.
* Configuration Management: Store and update settings in text files.
* File Maintenance: Create, update, and delete logs or configuration files.
